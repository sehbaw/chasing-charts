# chasing-charts

A blog where I discuss data driven stories I have read and reverse engineer, discuss charts and overall quality of the story. 


Technologies: Just the typical HTML, CSS, JS. I attempted to incorporate 11ty w/o javascript keeping it a static site as I had wanted but then conflicts and design issues ocurred so that will have to happen at a later date :0
