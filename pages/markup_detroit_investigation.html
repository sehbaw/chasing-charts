        <title>Marking up Markup's Investigation on the Auto Industry</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <p>The Markup is a really cool organization. I was able to discover them 
        through a friend who knows how much I enjoy read ProPublica investigations in
        my free time. They know how much I am interested in critical technology and ethical technology. 
        </p>
    
    <p> The first thing I notice is the the visual investigation and writeup are two different links.
        </p>
    <p> As one clicks through the investigation it an interesting mix of illustration
        and a scrollytelly story. Mike Bostock talks about how the importance of the fundamentals of a strong visualization
        which does not always need to include interactive elements. That can take away from the experience.
        However since this scrollytelly story was only conducted in vertical storytelling not taking away too much from the story but rahter
        adding motion to the fabolous illustrations depicted.
